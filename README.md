# $${\color{Purple}JellyBean}$$
Turning 25 is a big deal, and I wanted a way to celebrate it not just when it arrives, but all the way leading up to it. $${\color{Purple}JellyBean}$$ is a whimsical and nostalgic countdown timer built with JavaScript, counting down to my 25th birthday in 2029 styled in a sparkly TrinketScore aesthetic.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. The countdown will automatically update to show the number of days remaining.

> You can change the date to your birthdate by editing the countDownDate in the `script.js` code:
```js
var countDownDate = new Date("Apr 1, 2029").getTime();
```
## Future Plans
- [ ] Add a big celebratory animation (confetti, sparkle burst, sound effect) when the countdown reaches zero.
- [ ] Functional input button for user to add a new date directly on the browser.
